  I am a psych nurse with ten years of experience.  I have an MA in Communication Studies and an MSN with a focus on nursing informatics.  I have worked in the behavioral health section of the emergency department; on locked, adult acute care units from 10 to 29 patients.  I have also worked in the emplyee health/infection control department which required keeping employee files up-to-date, as well as administering vaccinations, conducting mask fit tests, and conducting TB tests. 
  I enter the full stack coding bootcamp for personal growth and had to look everything up because it was all a foreign language to me.  This portfolio shows how much I've learned and my progress in the last three months.
